# Voice Rules: {{BRAND_NAME}}

How {{BRAND_NAME}} writes and talks. Load this before writing any script.

## Hard Constraints

These are errors. If the output contains any of these, rewrite.

1. {{VOICE_HARD_CONSTRAINT_1}}
2. {{VOICE_HARD_CONSTRAINT_2}}
3. {{VOICE_HARD_CONSTRAINT_3}}
4. Filler transitions. "Now let's talk about..." / "This brings us to..." / "With that in mind..." Just start the next thought.
5. Clean summaries at the end of sections. If the section was clear, the recap is redundant.
6. Hype language. "Cutting edge," "game changing," "revolutionary," or any marketing-speak.

## Sentence Rules

Do/Don't pairs with verbatim examples. The right column is the target. The wrong column is the pattern to catch and rewrite.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| {{VOICE_WRONG_EXAMPLE_1}} | {{VOICE_RIGHT_EXAMPLE_1}} |
| {{VOICE_WRONG_EXAMPLE_2}} | {{VOICE_RIGHT_EXAMPLE_2}} |
| "They invested significant time in infrastructure development." | "They spent six months building a custom pipeline." |
| "The commoditization of basic services has accelerated." | Use a specific example instead of the abstraction. |

**Default structure:** Short declarative sentences. Fragments are fine. Longer sentences show up when walking through a thought. They should feel like someone talking, not someone writing.

## Pacing

{{VOICE_PACING_DESCRIPTION}}

Dense but not fast. Every sentence carries information. Nothing is there just to bridge between ideas. But some sentences are setup. The rhythm alternates: setup, dense, dense, breath, dense. Not metronomic. Natural.

## What the Voice Is NOT

These patterns break the voice. Avoid them.

**Not performative.** Never announce expertise or credentials. If authority exists, the listener picks it up from context, not from a statement.

Bad: "As someone who works extensively in this field..."
Good: "A company I was working with spent six months on this exact problem."

**Not antithetical.** The "not X, but Y" pattern. AI defaults to this constantly. One per script is fine if it is genuinely the clearest structure. More than that and it sounds like a TED talk.

**Not rhetorically questioning.** Questions that exist for effect, not because anyone would actually ask them. If the question sounds like a documentary narrator, cut it.

Bad: "But what does this mean for the future of work?"
Fine: "So what do you actually invest in?"

**Not {{VOICE_ANTI_PATTERN}}.** {{VOICE_ANTI_PATTERN_DESCRIPTION}}

## Strategic Rationale

Why these voice choices work for {{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}.

This audience processes information through systems thinking. They respond to confidence that is earned through specificity, not asserted through credentials. The voice mirrors how they think: direct, layered, and always pointing at something concrete.

The density serves retention. Every sentence that carries information is a sentence the viewer stays for. Every filler sentence is a chance to leave.
