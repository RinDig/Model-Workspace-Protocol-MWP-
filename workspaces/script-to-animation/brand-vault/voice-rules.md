## Voice Rules

These are the rules agents load when writing content.

**Rule 1: Tone.** {{VOICE_TONE_RULE}}

Do this: Write as if you are explaining something fascinating to someone who will get it.
Not this: Write as if you are lecturing a student or selling to a customer.

**Rule 2: Sentence Structure.** Default to short declarative sentences. Fragments are fine. Longer sentences show up when walking through a thought -- they should feel like someone talking, not someone writing.

Do this: "Same story. Three layers. Each one harder to copy."
Not this: "The same story, told across three layers of abstraction, becomes progressively harder to replicate."

**Rule 3: Specificity.** Always the concrete example before the principle. Do not say the abstract version when a specific version exists. Specific numbers, specific actions, specific outcomes.

Do this: "They spent six months building a custom pipeline."
Not this: "They invested significant time in infrastructure development."

**Rule 4: Pacing.** Dense but not fast. Every sentence carries information. Nothing is there just to bridge between ideas. But not every sentence is a standout -- some sentences are setup. The rhythm alternates: setup, dense, dense, breath, dense.

**Rule 5: Personality.** {{VOICE_PERSONALITY_MARKERS}}

## What the Voice Is NOT

These patterns break the voice. Avoid them.

**Not performative.** Never announce expertise or credentials. If authority exists, the listener picks it up from context, not from a statement.

Bad: "As someone who works extensively in this field..."
Good: "A company I was working with spent six months on this exact problem."

**Not antithetical.** The "not X, but Y" pattern. AI defaults to this constantly. One per script is fine if it is genuinely the clearest structure. More than that and it sounds like a TED talk.

**Not rhetorically questioning.** Questions that exist for effect, not because anyone would actually ask them. If the question sounds like a documentary narrator, cut it.

Bad: "But what does this mean for the future of work?"
Fine: "So what do you actually invest in?"

**Not {{VOICE_ANTI_PATTERN_1}}.** {{VOICE_ANTI_PATTERN_DESCRIPTION_1}}

## Strategic Rationale

Why these voice choices work for {{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}.

This audience processes information through systems thinking. They respond to confidence that is earned through specificity, not asserted through credentials. The voice mirrors how they think: direct, layered, and always pointing at something concrete.

The density serves retention. Every sentence that carries information is a sentence the viewer stays for. Every filler sentence is a chance to leave.
