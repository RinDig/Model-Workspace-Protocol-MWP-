# Hook System

Every script opens with a hook. The hook is what stops the scroll. It must create a gap between what the viewer currently understands and what the video is about to show them.

{{BRAND_NAME}} defaults to {{HOOK_STYLE}} hooks, but any pattern below can work depending on the topic.

## Hook Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Ritual Entry

Start with a specific action the viewer has personally performed. Then reveal hidden complexity behind that action.

**Template:** "[Specific action]. [Absurd number of hidden operations]. [Number of systems involved]."

**Example:** "You tapped send. That triggered 12,000 operations across 7 layers."

**Best for:** Topics where everyday actions hide complex systems underneath.

**Avoid when:** The action is too niche for {{TARGET_AUDIENCE}} to have personally done.

**Key rule:** The action must be something the viewer has physically done, recently and frequently. "Tapped send" works for billions. "Wrote a SQL query" works for millions. "Configured a load balancer" works for thousands. The broader the action, the wider the reach.

### Pattern 2: The Bold Claim

State something that contradicts what the viewer believes. They stay to find out if you are right.

**Template:** "[Counterintuitive statement that challenges a common assumption]."

**Example:** "The most important line of code in your app is the one you didn't write."

**Best for:** Topics where conventional wisdom is wrong or incomplete.

**Avoid when:** The claim is something the audience has already heard. If it is a meme or a common talking point, it will not create tension.

---

### Pattern 3: The Impossible Question

Frame something ordinary as a puzzle that demands resolution.

**Template:** "[Question that sounds simple but has a surprisingly complex answer]."

**Example:** "How does your phone know where you are when you haven't told it?"

**Best for:** Topics where the answer involves multiple layers of hidden systems.

**Avoid when:** The audience already knows the answer.

---

### Pattern 4: The Semantic Paradox

Combine concepts that should not combine. The statement is so conceptually strange that it demands resolution.

**Template:** "[Two or more concepts combined in a way that seems impossible]."

**Example:** "What is the distance between the word 'king' and the word 'queen'?"

**Best for:** Abstract or mathematical topics that need a visceral entry point.

**Avoid when:** The paradox requires domain expertise to appreciate. It must land for a general audience.

## Choosing a Hook

The hook must pass one test: could the viewer scroll past this without needing to know the answer?

If yes, the tension is not strong enough. Rewrite.

The hook should ideally be the thesis of the entire video. The build gives the viewer tools to understand the hook. The close answers it. If the hook and the build feel like separate ideas, the video has no throughline.
