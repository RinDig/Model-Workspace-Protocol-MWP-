# Value Framework

Every piece of content must deliver on at least 2 of these value types. The value is locked before drafting begins (at the second checkpoint in the script stage process).

## Value Types

### NOVEL

The viewer encounters something they have not seen before. A fact, reframe, or perspective that breaks their current understanding.

{{VALUE_NOVEL_DESCRIPTION}}

### USABLE

The viewer can do something with this in the next 30 minutes. A tool, repo, process, mental model, or technique they can apply immediately.

{{VALUE_USABLE_DESCRIPTION}}

### QUESTION-GENERATING

The viewer leaves with a question they cannot stop thinking about. The content opens a door rather than closing one.

{{VALUE_QUESTION_DESCRIPTION}}

### INTERESTING

The idea is just worth thinking about. It does not need to be actionable or novel. It reframes something familiar in a way that makes the viewer pause.

{{VALUE_INTERESTING_DESCRIPTION}}

## How to Use

During the ideation checkpoint (Process Step 2), tag each concept angle with which value types it naturally hits. At the value brief checkpoint (Process Step 4), lock which value types this specific piece will deliver and fill in the specifics for each.

A piece that tries to hit all four will hit none well. Two strong value slots are better than four weak ones. Three is ideal when the concept supports it.
