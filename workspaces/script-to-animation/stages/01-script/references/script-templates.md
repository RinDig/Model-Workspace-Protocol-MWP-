# Script Templates: {{BRAND_NAME}}

Structural templates for different content types. Pick the template that fits your topic, then fill in the sections.

---

## Output Format

Every script starts with a metadata header:

```markdown
---
pillar: [which content pillar]
hook-type: [ritual-entry / bold-claim / impossible-question / semantic-paradox]
template: [explainer / listicle / story / comparison]
target-duration: [seconds or minutes]
platform: [platform name]
---
```

The body follows the template structure below.

## Template 1: The Layered Reveal

Take something familiar and reveal the hidden complexity beneath it. Build understanding beat by beat until the viewer sees a system they never knew existed.

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (2-3 seconds) -- The entry point. One action, one absurd number.
2. **Layer 1** (5-8 seconds) -- The first thing that happens. Name it, show it.
3. **Layer 2** (5-8 seconds) -- The next layer down. Name it, show it.
4. **Layer 3** (5-8 seconds) -- Deeper. This is where it starts getting surprising.
5. **Layer 4+** (5-8 seconds each) -- Keep going until you hit the bottom.
6. **Close** (3-5 seconds) -- Meaning, not summary. What should the viewer think differently?

**Best for:** {{BRAND_NAME}}'s core format. Systems, infrastructure, hidden processes.

**Key rule:** One concept per layer. Do not explain how a layer works internally. The accumulation of layers IS the argument.

## Template 2: The Explainer

Take a concept and make it click through a single, well-chosen analogy or example.

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (2-3 seconds) -- Why should the viewer care about this concept?
2. **Setup** (10-15 seconds) -- The familiar thing they already understand.
3. **Bridge** (5-10 seconds) -- How the familiar thing maps to the unfamiliar concept.
4. **Core Concept** (15-25 seconds) -- The thing itself, explained through the bridge.
5. **Implication** (5-10 seconds) -- Why this matters beyond the explanation.
6. **Close** (3-5 seconds) -- A new mental model, not a summary.

**Best for:** Abstract concepts that need a concrete entry point.

## Template 3: The Story Arc

Tell a real story where the outcome reveals something about how systems work.

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (2-3 seconds) -- A surprising outcome or decision.
2. **Setup** (10-15 seconds) -- Who, what, why. The situation before.
3. **Tension** (15-20 seconds) -- What went wrong, what was at stake.
4. **Resolution** (10-15 seconds) -- What happened and why.
5. **Close** (3-5 seconds) -- What this story reveals about the broader system.

**Best for:** Case studies, historical events, real-world failures.

---

## Template 4: The Comparison

Put two approaches side by side. Let the contrast make the argument.

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (2-3 seconds) -- The choice or contrast, stated sharply.
2. **Option A** (15-20 seconds) -- How the first approach works.
3. **Option B** (15-20 seconds) -- How the second approach works.
4. **The Difference** (10-15 seconds) -- What actually separates them.
5. **Close** (3-5 seconds) -- A verdict or reframe, not a "both are valid."

**Best for:** Technology choices, competing approaches, paradigm shifts.

## Choosing a Template

Match the template to the topic's natural shape:
- Everyday action hides complex system? **Layered Reveal.**
- Abstract concept needs a concrete entry? **Explainer.**
- Real event reveals how something works? **Story Arc.**
- Two approaches, one is better or more interesting? **Comparison.**

If none fit cleanly, default to Layered Reveal. It is {{BRAND_NAME}}'s core format.
